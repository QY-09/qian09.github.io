# Hi, I'm Qian

Welcome to my technical blog! I use this space to document what I'm learning in computational geometry, algorithms, machine learning, and simulation-based design.

You’ll find notes, code snippets, and mini-projects—mostly written in C++ and Python—as I explore the theory and practice behind geometric algorithms, numerical methods, and optimization.

Thanks for stopping by!

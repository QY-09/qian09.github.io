# 🧠 Q's Tech Blog

Welcome to my personal GitHub blog where I document things I'm learning/reviewing/summary — from algorithms and computational geometry to C++, Python, machine learning, and more. This blog serves as both a personal knowledge base and a portfolio of my growth as a researcher and engineer.

## 📚 Topics I Cover

- ✨ Computational Geometry (e.g., sweep lines, triangulation, convex hulls)
- 🔧 Algorithm Implementation in C++ & Python
- 🧮 Numerical Methods & Topology Optimization
- 🧠 Machine Learning (basics, projects, experiments)
- 📘 Book Notes & Chapter Summaries
- 🛠️ Tools & Workflow Tips (e.g., Git, Jekyll, VSCode, Make)

## 📝 Blog Structure

Each blog post is stored in the `_posts/` folder (if using Jekyll) or inside topic-specific folders. I use Markdown to write posts and generate the static site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + GitHub Pages.
